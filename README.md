# Jet
A simple 3D arcade fighter jet game written in Unity.

The player controls a fighter jet while enemy jets appear before him. Jets can fire with a gun and
with guided missiles.
I wrote the game while I was on a vacation trip wih my friends in Israel and dedicated it to my
brother who is a big fan of airplanes.
